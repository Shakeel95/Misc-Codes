# Experiments

Miscellaneous bits of code for little statistical experiments that don't yet / will never lead to projects with repositories of their own. Each bit of code belongs in its own folder. This is my attempt at documenting trial-and-error research; some experiments obviouly lead nowehere, and none of the code is optimized. 

The convention is for **verbose** folder names. Each folder contains:

1. A README file briefly describing the experiment

2. Some code for the experiment
