# Misc-Codes

Miscellaneous bits of code for little statistical experiments that don't yet / will never lead to projects with repositories of their own. Each bit of code belongs in its own folder. The convention is for **verbose** folder names. Each folder contains:

1.  Some code

2.  A README file briefly describing the code
